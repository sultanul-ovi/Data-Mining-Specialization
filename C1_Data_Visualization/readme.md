# Data Visualization

This course will teach you how to make more effective visualizations of data. Not only will you gain deeper insight into the data, but you will also learn how to better communicate that insight to others. You will learn new ways to display data, applying some fundamental principles of design and human cognition to choose the most effective way to display different kinds of data. This course not only teaches you how to use popular applications like Tableau to connect to data warehouses to extract and visualize relevant data, but also teaches you how Tableau works so you can use the same techniques to make effective data visualizations on your own with any visualization system.

## Course Outline

The course consists of 4 weekly modules that focus on the following.

### Week 1: The Computer and the Human

Key Concepts:

Introduction to visualization

Using computer graphics to display data

The model human processor and Fitts's law

Human visual perception and cognition

Option 1 – Good Visualization
Background

Review the definition of data visualization and the differences between interactive visualization, presentation visualization, and online storytelling

Question

What web page URL would you point people to as a good example of presentation visualization or interactive storytelling? Which is it and why is it a good example of this type? What about the web page impresses you the most? How does the web page help you understand the data and gain insight into what the data represents?

Option 2 – Optical Illusion
Background

Review your notes on visual perception and the various factors that can lead to the misinterpretation of an image. (In particular, review your lecture notes from or revisit the lectures "The Human Retina," "Perceiving Two Dimensions," and "Perceiving Perspective.")

Question

What is a favorite optical illusion of yours? Can you provide a pointer to an image or video demonstrating it? Or better yet, can you reproduce your own version of it? Why is this an optical illusion? What elements of the human visual perceptual system are causing the effect of the illusion?





### Week 2: Visualization of Numerical Data

Key Concepts:

Different kinds of visualizations and how best to apply them to data

Basic charts such as bar charts and scatter plots

More advanced visualization techniques, such as streamgraphs and parallel coordinates

Some elements of design and color usage

### Week 3: Visualization of Non-Numerical Data

Key Concepts:

Graphs, networks, and hierarchies

Layout of relational and hierarchical data, such as treemaps

Methods for visualizing high-dimensional data, such as principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling

### Week 4: The Visualization Dashboard

Key Concepts:

Visualizing large datasets

Visualization of databases and data mining results

Visual analytics for decision support

Task analysis

Visualization dashboards
