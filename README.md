# Data Mining Specialization

A 6-course Coursera specialization covering data mining techniques for structured and unstructured data.

## Overview

This specialization focuses on:

- Pattern discovery
- Clustering
- Text retrieval
- Text mining and analytics
- Data visualization

The capstone project involves solving real-world data mining challenges using Yelp restaurant review data.

### 2. Text Retrieval and Search Engines (30 hours)

- Search engine technologies
- Text data analysis and pattern discovery

### 3. Text Mining and Analytics (33 hours)

- Statistical approaches to text mining
- Pattern finding and knowledge discovery in text data

### 4. Pattern Discovery in Data Mining (17 hours)

- General data mining concepts
- Scalable pattern discovery methods
- Mining diverse patterns, including sequential and sub-graph patterns

### 5. Cluster Analysis in Data Mining (16 hours)

- Clustering methodologies and algorithms
- Partitioning, hierarchical, and density-based methods
- Clustering validation and evaluation

### 6. Data Mining Project (10 hours)

- Application of learned techniques to real-world challenges
- Analysis of Yelp review data set
- Tasks include:
  1. Opinion visualization
  2. Cuisine map construction
  3. Popular dish discovery
  4. Restaurant recommendation

## Project Workflow

- Data preprocessing
- Data exploration
- Data analysis
- Method improvement
- Result presentation

Students will combine multiple algorithms, experiment with problem-solving approaches, and are encouraged to explore their own ideas.

Final deliverables include task-specific reports and a consolidated report, both peer-graded.
