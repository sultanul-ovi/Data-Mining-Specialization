# üìù **Syllabus: Text Mining and Analytics**

---

## üìñ **Course Description**

Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of **natural language text data**, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, and social media. Text data, rich in semantic content generated by humans, are invaluable for discovering **knowledge** about people‚Äôs opinions, preferences, and more. However, unlike structured data, text data lack explicit structure, making it challenging for computers to process and understand.

This course introduces approaches for **mining and analyzing text data** effectively, focusing on methods that require minimal manual effort. You will learn techniques for mining word associations, analyzing topics, clustering and categorizing text, **opinion mining**, and **joint analysis of text and non-text data**.

## üéØ **Course Goals and Objectives**

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- üß† **Explain** fundamental concepts and major algorithms in **text mining and analytics**.
- üìä **Apply statistical language models**, including **topic models**, to analyze text data.
- üíª **Implement** text mining algorithms and experiment with real-world text mining tasks (if you complete the programming assignment).
